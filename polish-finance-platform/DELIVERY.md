   - Fundamental Analyst (valuation metrics)
   - Technical Analyst (charts, trends, signals)
   - Sentiment Analyst (market consensus)
3. **User features**:
   - Price alerts
   - Portfolio tracking
   - Trade history
4. **Automated monitoring** - Alert system for price movements

### Backend Files Ready:
All backend code is prepared in `/workspace/polish-finance-platform/`:
- `schema.sql` - Database structure (5 tables)
- `supabase/functions/` - 5 edge functions ready to deploy
- `setup-backend.sh` - Step-by-step deployment guide

**To deploy backend** (optional):
1. Get Supabase account (free tier available)
2. Follow `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
